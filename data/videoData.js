      "In this chapter of the Pulsar Mania ABC of Stunting Series we teach you how to jump a motorcycle. This is an essential skill when you go off the beaten track or even when you go off road. We start with the basics - first walk the track or ride slowly and check out the obstacle that you want to jump over. Then start slow understand what the motorcycle is doing and then build up your speeds. The basic technique is pull in the clutch just before the jump and blip the throttle to lift the nose. Stand loose with the knees bent so the bent knee takes the impact of the landing and does not hit your spine. And never use the front brake when you are landing otherwise the bike will nose dive.",
